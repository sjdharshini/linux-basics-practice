Day 3 – Viewing Files

• Learned how to view file contents using cat and less
• Used touch to create files
• Understood how Linux handles basic files and directories
touch → creates a new empty file
cat   → displays the content of a file in the terminal
less  → views file content page by page (useful for large files)
